# password-management-system
The problem that the password management system aims to solve is the issue of password security and management. Many individuals and organizations struggle with creating and remembering strong passwords, and often end up using weak or easily guessable passwords.
This can lead to security breaches and data loss, as weak passwords are more susceptible to being hacked or guessed.In addition, managing multiple passwords across various online accounts can be a time-consuming and confusing task. Users may forget their passwords,or they may reuse the same password across multiple accounts, which can also increase the risk of a security breach. The password management system aims to solve these problems by providing a central location for storing and managing passwords, as well as tools for generating strong passwords.
By using this system, individuals and organizations can improve their password security and reduce the risk of data loss or security breaches.
